 tech_arcane_deciphering_desc:0 "Various artifacts and technologies functioning by arcane means that cannot be understood or replicated... at least not by conventional science as it is known to us. $dttr_tech_arcane_deciphering_desc$"
 tech_archaeostudies_desc:0 "This new field of studies focuses on the practical applications of ancient artifacts. We are far from being the first galactic civilization to tread these stars. With a bit of work, their legacies could secure our future. $dttr_tech_archaeostudies_desc$"
 tech_secrets_cybrex_desc:0 "To build their ring world, the Cybrex relied on highly efficient mining drones to survey and harvest orbital resources. Cybrex-made memory chips and sensors could outfit our own mining drones, so that we might put their millennia old algorithms to good use. $dttr_tech_secrets_cybrex_desc$"
 tech_secrets_league_desc:0 "The sprawling empire of the First League dwarfed our own at its peak, and relied on implacable bureaucracy to keep the wheels of the state in motion. The quantic filing arrays they used afforded them unprecedented efficiency in the sorting and storing of documents. $dttr_tech_secrets_league_desc$"
 tech_secrets_irassian_desc:0 "The Irassian astronaval tradition was unmatched in their time. Their shipyards produced a constant stream of ships for their navy and merchant fleets, which would ultimately be their downfall. With so many ships, and such a high reliance on them, the Irassians were powerless to quarantine the disease that would claim their empire. $dttr_tech_secrets_irassian_desc$"
 tech_secrets_vultaum_desc:0 "The reality computers of the Vultaums were unique processing units, dedicated to analyzing existence itself, not quite through physics, but rather by trying to reverse engineer reality's source code and find the glitch that would finally allow the Vultaums to take down the simulation where they believed they lived. $dttr_tech_secrets_vultaum_desc$"
 tech_secrets_yuht_desc:0 "The Yuht were a paradoxical society, obsessed with the idea of finding other sentient species, yet refusing to accept that they were not alone. They were so focused on disproving any claim of alien life, that their bias found a way into their technology. However, with the proper modifications and calibrations, we could certainly fix their powerful detection arrays. $dttr_tech_secrets_yuht_desc$"
 tech_secrets_baol_desc:0 "The Baol Organism had a unique way of producing tools. Given the species' relative slowness, they would simply grow them out of organic matter in locations that were half orchard, half factory. With the proper genetic adjustments, we could also grow various commodities and tools alongside our regular crops. $dttr_tech_secrets_baol_desc$"
 tech_secrets_zroni_desc:0 "Zro is a fascinating element, prone to chaotic bursts of energy. We believe that with the right artifacts, we could use it to fuel spatial storms over entire solar systems. $dttr_tech_secrets_zroni_desc$"
 tech_archaeoshield_desc:0 "Projected farther than regular shields, the suspension field technology uses ancient artifacts to slow time at the point of impact to afford the shields a longer opportunity to dispel the incoming attack's energy. $dttr_tech_archaeoshield_desc$"
 tech_archaeoarmor_desc:0 "Ionized plates of armor can carry a reactive charge to alleviate the energy of impacts, using magnetic repulsion and field projection principles. $dttr_tech_archaeoarmor_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_detection_scrambler_desc:0 "Ping repeaters and optic diffusers with the right wavelengths can produce destructive interference and effectively scramble hostile targeting systems. $dttr_tech_archaeo_detection_scrambler_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_rampart_desc:0 "Defense platforms are a cost effective way to ensure our safety, but they need to be monitored from an operation center. Fortifying our Starbase to ensure its survivability in the event of an attack, and maximizing our capacity to network independent orbital defenses would give us more time to dispatch reinforcements. $dttr_tech_archaeo_rampart_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_titan_beam_desc:0 "Tremendous medium range firepower will enable our titans to break through enemy lines. These ancient cannons were once the foundation upon which a galactic empire was built. $dttr_tech_archaeo_titan_beam_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_overcharger_desc:0 "Supercharging shields can be done safely thanks to ancient stabilizer coils and dampeners. In addition to the production of a stronger force field, this also has the added benefit of outright vaporizing certain incoming projectiles. $dttr_tech_archaeo_overcharger_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_refinery_desc:0 "This millennia-old processing equipment has an efficiency rate above 100%. Its functioning remains alien, but its production gains are substantial. $dttr_tech_archaeo_refinery_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_pk_devolving_beam_desc:0 "A colossal mind-wiping cannon, which unleashes a planet-wide wave of energy returning most sentient life to a pre-sapient state. Engineers estimate that with additional tuning, it might also be used to wipe clean memory banks and disable robotic units. $dttr_tech_archaeo_pk_devolving_beam_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_mass_drivers_desc:0 "These cannons of gargantuan size deliver relatively slow but devastating projectiles, and can fire pretty much anything, from scrap metal, to asteroid chunks. $dttr_tech_archaeo_mass_drivers_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_lasers_desc:0 "This high energy weapon causes brutal micro collapsing events on impact, generating tremendous heat and force inside its targets armor. $dttr_tech_archaeo_lasers_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_point_defence_desc:0 "When it comes to tracking and shooting down missiles, these antique batteries are the best of the best, making use of a predictive algorithm written in long forgotten code to weave a fiery defensive web. $dttr_tech_archaeo_point_defence_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_missiles_desc:0 "Particle charges, once stabilized thanks to ancient technology, allow us to create swarms of tiny missiles that still carry a respectable payload, and should be able to overwhelm most point-defense systems. $dttr_tech_archaeo_missiles_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_mass_accelerator_desc:0 "This cannon fires a barrage of ancient miniscule ionized spheres that charge upon contact with most force fields, giving them high levels of shield penetration. Any theory that these spheres could have been used for jewelry purposes were dismissed when a critical incident melted an entire laboratory. $dttr_tech_archaeo_mass_accelerator_desc$"
 tech_archaeo_strike_crafts_desc:0 "These high velocity drones have been equipped with antique mining lasers that virtually ignore any plating protecting their target. A tech too good to be wasted on astro mining. $dttr_tech_archaeo_strike_crafts_desc$"
