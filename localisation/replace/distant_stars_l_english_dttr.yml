 tech_nanite_repair_system_desc:0 "A highly effective hull auto-repair system comprised of billions of microscopic nanomachines was found among the smoking remains of the Scavenger, and has been repurposed for our uses. Whether the Scavenger pilfered this system from an ancient derelict, or was originally constructed with it remains unknown. $dttr_tech_nanite_repair_system_desc$"
 tech_neuroregeneration_desc:0 "When tailored to a species' genome, this form of tissue engineering has intensive neuroregenerative properties, significantly increasing the development of neurons, axons, and synapses in its recipient. $dttr_tech_neuroregeneration_desc$"
 tech_nanite_autocannon_desc:0 "Highly advanced autocannons capable of ejecting shells that explode into a cloud of nanites at the target, overwhelming shields and chewing through hull sections. $dttr_tech_nanite_autocannon_desc$"
 tech_nanite_flak_batteries_desc:0 "Improving upon previous designs by launching canisters of nanites capable of eating away at strike craft, these flak batteries are the bane of any fighter pilot. $dttr_tech_nanite_flak_batteries_desc$"
 tech_gargantuan_evolution_desc:0 "Voidspawn eggs have evolved to withstand the harsh conditions of space by absorbing and conserving energy from their nearest star. $dttr_tech_gargantuan_evolution_desc$"
 tech_mine_aldar_desc:0 "Volatile Aldar is only found laced in more common ores. Successfully extracting Aldar crystals from these mineral matrices - without sustaining significant damage to equipment and operators - requires advanced auto-tactile machinery. $dttr_tech_mine_aldar_desc$"
 tech_repeatable_lcluster_clue_desc:0 "Intensive study within the fields of nanomachinery and subspace phenomena will eventually yield a new §Y$clue$§! into the $lgate_disabled$ mystery. $dttr_tech_repeatable_lcluster_clue_desc$"
 tech_lgate_activation_desc:0 "The L-Gates defy our current understanding of subspace mechanics. This must be remedied before they can be opened for travel. $dttr_tech_lgate_activation_desc$"
 tech_experimental_subspace_navigation_desc:0 "Solitary Science Ships can break out of the naturally-occurring hyperlanes and attempt to navigate to known but otherwise unreachable destinations. $dttr_tech_experimental_subspace_navigation_desc$"
 tech_databank_uplinks_desc_hive_mind:0 "A novel new use for explorator drones has been found: by keeping them in orbit and amplifying their mindlink planet-wide, new speculative paths of discovery are revealed. Even the feeble synapses of billions of worker drones, taken together, have a cumulative effect. $dttr_tech_databank_uplinks_hive_mind_desc$"
 tech_improved_databank_uplinks_desc_hive_mind:0 "Prolonged exposure to explorator mindlinks is inducing synergetic effects in the synapses of worker drones. $dttr_tech_improved_databank_uplinks_hive_mind_desc$"
