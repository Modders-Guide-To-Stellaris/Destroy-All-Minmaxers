 tech_cloaking_1_desc:0 "A modified particle field allows our vessels to effectively 'hide' in open space. However, this comes at the cost of destabilizing other forms of energy shielding which would otherwise protect the ship. $dttr_tech_cloaking_1_desc$"
 tech_cloaking_2_desc:0 "Advancements in rare crystal lensing technology have greatly improved cloaking efficiency. $dttr_tech_cloaking_2_desc$"
 tech_cloaking_3_desc:0 "Typical cloaking technology can play havoc with a ship's more delicate instruments. However, these elite fields render such concerns obsolete. $dttr_tech_cloaking_3_desc$"
 tech_cloaking_dark_matter_desc:0 "This device uses dark matter to warp space-time around the vessel, making it incredibly difficult to detect. $dttr_tech_cloaking_dark_matter_desc$"
 tech_cloaking_psi_desc:0 "Psi-Phase Field Generators focus the psionic potential of the ship's crew to partially phase the vessel into the Shroud. This allows the ship to remain undetected by all but the best sensor arrays, though what the crew may be forced to witness is better left unsaid. $dttr_tech_cloaking_psi_desc$"
 tech_detection_array_desc:0 "$sm_detection_array_desc$ $dttr_tech_detection_array_desc$"
 tech_dark_matter_detection_desc:0 "Dark matter resonance chambers will significantly improve the performance of our detection arrays. $dttr_tech_dark_matter_detection_desc$"
 tech_assisted_detection_desc:0 "Coupling detection arrays with the computers onboard our science vessels can vastly increase their scanning resolution. $dttr_tech_assisted_detection_desc$"
 tech_unusual_senses_desc:0 "Nothing is more innovative than natural evolution. By studying how pre-FTL societies view their world, we have devised new methods of detecting uninvited ships. $dttr_tech_unusual_senses_desc$"
 tech_new_numbers_desc:0 "After studying multiple pre-FTL civilizations, we have realized that there are many alternative ways to calculate the universe. It has even introduced new numbers into our mathematics. $dttr_tech_new_numbers_desc$"
 tech_trinary_computing_desc:0 "Different societies have developed alternative solutions for their logistics and computing. These alien ways of thinking have made it easier for us to adapt to foreign empires' structures. $dttr_tech_trinary_computing_desc$"
 tech_atmospheric_orbital_mechanics_desc:0 "Due to our vast experience operating observation stations in orbit of pre-FTL worlds, we have discovered slight optimizations. By implementing them empire-wide, we can drastically reduce the maintenance our stations require. $dttr_tech_atmospheric_orbital_mechanics_desc$"
 tech_predatory_tactics_desc:0 "Just like how clever pre-FTLs move to conceal each other as they approach an enemy, so too can our pilots move faster without disrupting their cloaking field. $dttr_tech_predatory_tactics_desc$"
 tech_satisfying_insults_desc:0 "Nothing is quite as powerful as a well-placed insult, and we now know how to insult a species's progenitor in many languages. $dttr_tech_satisfying_insults_desc$"
 tech_compact_living_desc:0 "While no one civilization has the perfect solution to the ever-expanding challenge of governing a growing nation, we have found a partial solution. After studying a multitude of species and governments, we have discovered an outstanding balance of flexibility and function. $dttr_tech_compact_living_desc$"
 tech_alien_topography_desc:0 "Civilizations flourish in locations that promotes growth, and by analyzing where the majority of pre-FTL settlements thrive we can gain more out of our colonies. $dttr_tech_alien_topography_desc$"
 tech_xeno_aesthetics_desc:0 "After analyzing a multitude of artists from drastically different cultures, we have come up with a general theorem. By studying a civilization's art and culture, we can gain an advantage against them in combat. $dttr_tech_xeno_aesthetics_desc$"
 tech_lost_building_methods_desc:0 "Any civilization with a long enough history has examples of great wonders built by forgotten ancients which can no longer be replicated. Luckily for us we have documented these great ancients when they appeared on pre-FTL worlds. $dttr_tech_lost_building_methods_desc$"
 tech_supreme_alloy_desc:0 "What we thought was the greatest alloy turned out to be far from the truth. Countless pre-FTL refining processes have been cataloged, and we have now synthesized an unbeatable metal. $dttr_tech_supreme_alloy_desc$"
 tech_ordered_retreat_desc:0 "While studying the victors of battles might be the most obvious way to gain insight from combat, observing the loser on pre-FTL worlds has taught us how to organize our withdraws more effectively. $dttr_tech_ordered_retreat_desc$"
 tech_temple_of_transportation_desc:0 "Transportation networks bring people together: a sentiment shared by many civilization we observed. While we do not have steam engines, our hyper relay networks could serve a similar purpose. $dttr_tech_temple_of_transportation_desc$"
